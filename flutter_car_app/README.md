# Flutter Application

This Flutter application is designed todetect potholes and bumps on a map in real-time. The app uses the Flutter framework to provide a smooth, cross-platform experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Flutter SDK**: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Dart SDK** (bundled with Flutter)
- **Android Studio** (or Xcode for iOS) with appropriate plugins
- **VS Code** (optional but recommended) with Flutter and Dart plugins
- **Git** for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the root of your project and run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Check Flutter Configuration**:
   Verify that Flutter is set up correctly on your machine:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```
   Make sure all dependencies (Android SDK, iOS setup, etc.) are correctly installed. Resolve any issues listed by `flutter doctor`.

### Running the App

You can run this app on a physical device or an emulator/simulator.

#### For Android

1. **Start an Android Emulator**:
   - Open Android Studio, go to **AVD Manager**, and start an emulator.
   - Or, use the terminal:
     ```bash
     emulator -avd <emulator-name>
     ```

2. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

#### For iOS

1. **Start an iOS Simulator**:
   - Open Xcode, go to **Preferences > Components**, and install a simulator if needed.
   - Or, from the terminal:
     ```bash
     open -a Simulator
     ```

2. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Running on Web

Flutter also supports running applications in a web browser.

1. **Enable Web Support**:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-web
   ```

2. **Run the App on Web**:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

### Building for Release

To create a release build, follow these instructions:

#### Android Release Build

1. **Build the APK**:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

2. The APK file will be generated in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory.

#### iOS Release Build

1. **Build for iOS**:
   ```bash
   flutter build ios --release
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode and configure signing in **Runner > Signing & Capabilities**. Then archive and upload to the App Store if necessary.

### Folder Structure

- **lib**: Contains all Dart files, including main app logic and UI components.
- **assets**: Contains image, audio, and other assets used by the app.
- **test**: Holds unit and widget tests for the app.

### Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**:
  - Run `flutter clean` if you encounter build issues, then `flutter pub get`.
  - Ensure all SDK paths are set correctly if dependencies aren’t detected by `flutter doctor`.

- **Useful Commands**:
  - `flutter run` - Runs the app on a connected device.
  - `flutter build <platform>` - Builds the app for a specific platform.
  - `flutter doctor` - Checks your environment for any issues.

### Contributing

1. Fork the project.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
